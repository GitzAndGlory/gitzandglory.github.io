For those unfamiliar, Kill Team is a fast-paced skirmish game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, where you fight small battles with about 6 to 14 miniatures for each team.</p><h2 id=meet-the-shadowfangs>Meet the Shadowfangs</h2><p>The team I am playing is called &quot;The Shadowfangs&quot; (funy edgy name, haha). They once were loyal to the Imperium of Mankind but stumbled upon an old shrine to Chaos. After witnessing the disregard of the Imperium for the average men and women living in it, The Shadowfangs vowed to do anything in their power to hinder the Imperial War Machine.</p><p>I made these Catachans using the SpaceNam kit, a 3D printed Yarrick, and an Ogryn from the Necromunda Slave Ogryn kit. At first, I made them to play Veteran Guard, but I soon fell in love with the Blooded and tried to get my hands on an Ogryn and Commissar as soon as possible. I painted them as regular Catachans, but I plan to chaosify them over the course of the campaign. The Ogryn &quot;Stonefist&quot; has already turned into a certified Khorne enjoyer, so the first steps have been taken to become slaves to the dark gods.</p><p><img src=/assets/images/blog-images/khorne-enjoyer.jpg alt=""></p><h2 id=the-first-mission-the-shadowfangs-vs-the-expendables>The First Mission: The Shadowfangs vs. The Expendables</h2><p>They immediately faced off against their old brothers in arms, &quot;The Expendables,&quot; which also consisted of Catachans counting as Veteran Guard, filled with delightful war and action references for their operative names. We played Mission 3.2 &quot;Destroy Foundations&quot; with me as the attacker and The Expendables as the defender.</p><p>The Shadowfangs were about to blow up a strategic supply stash of the Imperium, just when they found out that The Expendables were guarding the stash all along, as if the loyalist Catachans knew how their fallen brothers would act.</p><p>The Shadowfangs started their pincer assault on the stash with their Plasma Gunner picking off targets from behind, and the Enforcer making him shoot twice in one round. Melee specialists and Sergeant Kael were on the flanks. Finally, the Ogryn was stomping down the midfield followed by his friends, the Melta Gunner and the Corpseman. Shanter the Flenser charged into the main building, facing four of his old brethren at once, but fell to a bionic fist to the face from The Expendables&#39; Hardened Veteran. Stonefist, the Ogryn, was filled with Khorne&#39;s rage after getting hit by a frag grenade and immediately charged and killed their Grenade Launcher Gunner. Meanwhile, the Brimstone Grenadier barely did any damage to two troopers with his Diabolyk Bomb and was immediately cooked by the Melta Gunner for his trouble. All the while, The Expendables&#39; sniper &quot;Major König&quot; and his spotter buddy took potshots from their backlines. After blowing up the main building and taking major losses, The Shadowfangs opted for a strategic retreat, as they had already done enough damage.</p><p>It was a pretty lethal game (luckily no Battle Scars at all for either of us) as Vet Guard tends to lose a lot of models, and the Blooded kind of want to take some losses. The Expendables were able to defend the supplies and got the Spec Ops bonus of the mission, but The Shadowfangs won overall with a one-point lead.</p><h2 id=campaign-hype>Campaign Hype</h2><p>After playing a few games of Mordheim in a strange, but very fun, three-player campaign, always playing free-for-alls, I got my first taste of playing in a wargaming campaign. Now that I joined this Kill Team campaign and played my first campaign game, my head is racing with images of my warband fighting against their old brothers in arms. I got insanely hyped for playing Kill Team and playing more narrative games. Narrative truly is the best way to play wargames, and I really need to try to implement this aspect into my casual one-off games of Kill Team and OnePageRules.</p><p>There will be more soon as I will introduce you to my second team in this campaign: Gear Guts&#39; Boyz, the compendium Greenskins team that will probably not win many games, but I really wanted to play with my Spanner and Lootas, so I&#39;m still pretty excited about seeing where they will end up in the campaign.</p></article></div></main><footer><div class=container><p>Email me: <a href=mailto:gitzandglory@gmail.com>gitzandglory@gmail.com</a></p><p class=copyright>© 2024 - Build with Metalsmith</p></div></footer></body></html>

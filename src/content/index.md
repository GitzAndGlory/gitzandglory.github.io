# Welcome to Gitz and Glory
<div class="welcome">
Whether you came here on purpose or a Warpstorm brought you here, thanks for stopping by! This is a (mainly) Warhammer blog by me, Daniel, who likes the colour green and collects Orks in Warhammer 40k. Here, I talk about my wargaming experiences, whether itâ€™s painting or playing with toy soldiers.

I hope you enjoy your stay on my little website. Feel free to write me an email at <a href="mailto:gitzandglory@gmail.com">gitzandglory@gmail.com</a> and have a great day!

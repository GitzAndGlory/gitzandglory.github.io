  Spanners and Lootas in Kill Team. Probably not a good idea.

Ork Meks have always been a soft spot of mine, and the junkyard aesthetic is probably one of my favorite parts of the entire Orks range (Still need to get out the Stompa for a game of 40k using the Dread Mob). In Kill Team, however, there is no such thing as a Dreadnought, not even a Killa Kan. Obviously, we then need to play the Greenskins Speshulists Fire Team and, of course, use my favorite weapon in all of 40k, the Kustom Mega-Blasta.

## The Funny Gun

Something about this gun just speaks to me in its dumb, orky simplicity. The Meks just thought, "What if we took a humie's Plasmagun but made it better?" What happened is a Plasmagun that does not need to overcharge (because it always is overcharged) and it shoots just as well as a regular Plasmagun. Granted, there is no need to have this deal more damage than a Plasmagun since it already kills most things instantly, but I would have loved some kind of upside to always needing to overcharge. Still, it's a Plasmagun with 4+ BS in Orks. And it's the coolest-looking gun I have ever seen. Just the thought of these football hooligans being able to build energy weapons is fun and terrifying at the same time.

The tradeoff for taking the Spanner is pretty big, though. The Nob can get to 3 APL with the Bosspole, slaps in melee, and can have a one-time Kombi-Rokkit, which is nothing to scoff at. The most important thing we lose out on is the 3 APL body and having one less operative since you can take the Nob in addition to a Boy Fireteam, unlike the Spanner who replaces a Speshulist.

## Da Boyz

Of course, we will take one Boy Fireteam to get three good old Slugga Choppa Boyz on the table. Their Choppas are almost as good as Assault Intercessor Chainswords, so they should cut most things up easily.

Gear Guts, the Mek, has found a tribe of feral Orks on his travels to find scrap, so he weaponized their tribal aggression and gave them metal Choppas and Sluggas.

To have some more Dakka, we are going to get a Boy with a Rokkit Launcher. It's not as good as a Plasmagun, lacking the second point of AP, but still packing quite a punch, as long as I get him a Targeting Fing to bump his WS to 4+.

Rounding out the Boy Fireteam, I added 2 Gretchin instead of the 4th Boy. I figured there might be a need for an action monkey in the funky world of narrative missions. They will run around and pick up stuff or turn valves, whatever they can get their grabby claws on.

## Now this... is Dakka
Finally, we get to my favorite part of this Kill Team: the 3 Lootas. Horrible rules wherever you see these models, but they just look delightfully orky.

Their Deffguns shoot 5 shots at BS 5+ and 4/6 Damage, which is a nice base to build on considering the Targetin' Fing making it shoot at 4+ and getting the Spec Ops weapon upgrades. Giving one of these +1 damage for more value with those 5 shots and being able to one-shot guardsmen with this thing sounds pretty good. Giving it P1! also sounds nice as it seems pretty likely to hit a crit with five attacks.

## Da Plan
I have a particular plan of how I am going to outfit my Greenskinz:

### Strategic Assets
Tactical Uplink seems like an auto-include to me. Free Just A Scratch or just having a free Command Reroll is just good. I don't think I will pass on that.

For our second choice, we will go for the Expanded Armory as soon as we get 4 Targetin' Fings. This way, we can have our 3 Lootas and the Rokkit Boy shoot at 4+ BS and have space for rare equipment.

### Battle Honors
Gun Ace seems like an obvious choice for all the ranged operatives on the team. For the melee Boyz, Bladework seems like the standout pick if I want to boost their melee output. The Grots (if they survive) will get the Runner upgrade to do their job of picking things up even better and increase their odds of surviving these endeavors.

### Spec Op
I have chosen Recover Archeotech since it fits the best with the backstory of this team. Gear Guts thinks his Warboss is a dumb git, so he wants to build a big Deffdread, maybe even a Stompa, to stomp his stupid old Boss into bits.

Trying to score Retrieval will also become a funny meme goal I will need to achieve to get my rare equipment.

## Getting ready to Krump
Soon, Gear Guts' Boyz will get onto the battlefields of Ferronia and show those other gits how propa lootin' is done. The first game with this team is coming up soon, so hopefully, it will be a fun game with lots of shooting attacks that do nothing. Until next time, have a good one :)
